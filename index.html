				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				Hi there! I'm Marina. I'm an experienced clinical research and data management professional looking to make full use of my project management and operations skills in the healthcare or environmental sectors.
				As a detail-oriented problem-solver I relish any opportunity to improve processes and operations for organizations with social justice driven missions. 
				My long-standing devotion to work that improves lives led me to my role at Dana-Farber.<br /> 
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				I love working on a team and can be happy helping someone else realize their vision, or taking the lead myself when appropriate. 
				I am interested in working with thoughtful and passionate people who are driven by the purpose of their work, and are interested in working together to build something better.<br /> 
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				Beyond work I like to travel, cook, play board games, and watch sports (biathlon is my favorite!).
