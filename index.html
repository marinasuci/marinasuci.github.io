				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				Hi! I'm Marina. I'm a recent college graduate looking to use my computing 
				and analysis skills for social change. I am most interested in the fields 
				of healthcare, environmental justice, and education.<br /> 
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
				When I started college I was very excited to learn more about the environment 
				and how we were affecting it. I immediately joined the Office of Sustainability 
				as a fellow and was introduced to the idea of holistic sustainability. 
				This view of sustainability necessitates a balance of and consideration for 
				environmental stewardship, social justice, and economic viability. 
				This made sense to me. Of course no solution could be long lasting without 
				taking all of these spheres into consideration! Through this view of sustainability 
				I found my true passion for social justice. I am interested in how environmental 
				degradation disproportionately affects certain people and therefore becomes a social issue. 
				Healthcare and education are similarly important to our communities and also require 
				equity and inclusion. I am excited to work towards these goals of just social structures 
				by using my technical, social, and organizational skills.
